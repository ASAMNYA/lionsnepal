            <p> Where there is a NEED, there is a LION. <br>
            Lions club international has been serving the helpless and needy people in every corner of the world.If we need to discuss about the fields where lions have been serving, it would not be wrong to say that no stone had been left unturned. The motto of the club “We Serve” is the single voice of all the lions around the world.<br>
            Lions Clubs plan and participate in a wide variety of service projects that meet the international goals of Lions Clubs International as well as the needs of their local communities.<br>
